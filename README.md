# sha256_generator
This script will search for .exe files in the current directory (you can change this by modifying the dir variable at the top of the script). For each .exe file, it will check if a corresponding .sha256 file already exists. If the .sha256 file exists, it will calculate the SHA256 hash of the .exe file and compare it to the hash stored in the .sha256 file. If the hashes match, the script will skip the file. If the hashes do not match, the script will display an error message and exit. If the .sha256 file does not exist, the script will calculate the SHA256 hash of the .exe file and store it in a new .sha256 file. When the script has finished processing all .exe files, it will display a message indicating that it has finished.
This script includes a log file (specified by the log_file variable) where it will log the results of each file processing step. It also includes error handling for when the hashes do not match. If the hashes do not match, the script will log an error message and exit.
